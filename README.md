## Dataset

Our contributions are mainly as follows: 
1) We use deep networks for video watermarking against tampering; 
2) We propose a tailored attacking layer for enhanced robustness against typical video post-processing attacks; 
3) Our method can achieve higher accuracy in locating tampered regions and is robust against multiple kinds of post-processing attacks.
